# What is Blume News

Blume News is a simple website that's similar to any common socail media website, but instead of posts about others lives, the website requests news articles from news API and displays it as content. Users can also write and view their own articles. The app was built using React, Vite, and Tailwind in the frontend, as well as NodeJS and MongoDB in the backend.

## How To Use 

The app is very similar to other socail websites, just create an account, and use the sidebar to navigate between pages. If you'd like to delete your account you can do so in settings.
